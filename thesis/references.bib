  abstract = {Agent-based models (ABM) are examples of complex adaptive systems, which can be characterized as those systems for which no model less complex than the system itself can accurately predict in detail how the system will behave at future times. Consequently, the standard tools of policy analysis, based as they are on devising policies that perform well on some best estimate model of the system, cannot be reliably used for ABM. This paper argues that policy analysis by using ABM requires an alternative approach to decision theory. The general characteristics of such an approach are described, and examples are provided of its application to policy analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper presents FlexiTaint, a hardware accelerator for dynamic taint propagation. FlexiTaint is implemented as an in-order addition to the back-end of the processor pipeline, and the taints for memory locations are stored as a packed array in regular memory. The taint propagation scheme is specified via a software handler that, given the operation and the sourcespsila taints, computes the new taint for the result. To keep performance overheads low, FlexiTaint caches recent taint propagation lookups and uses a filter to avoid lookups for simple common-case behavior. We also describe how to implement consistent taint propagation in a multi-core environment. Our experiments show that FlexiTaint incurs average performance overheads of only 1{\%} for SPEC2000 benchmarks and 3.7{\%} for Splash-2 benchmarks, even when simultaneously following two different taint propagation policies.},
