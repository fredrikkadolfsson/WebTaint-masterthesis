\chapter{Benchmarking}
This section describes the conduction of the benchmarking and comparison of the implemented Dynamic Taint Tracker. The chapter starts with a description of the \textit{\nameref{TestEnvironment}} followed by a detailed description about the \textit{\nameref{Evaluation}}

\section{Test Environment}
\label{TestEnvironment}
The execution of the benchmarking is conducted on a Asus Zenbook UZ32LN with the following specification:

\hfill
\begin{description}
	\item [Processor:] 2 GHz i7-4510U
	\item [Memory:] 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
	\item [Operating system:] Ubuntu 17.10
	\item [Java:] OpenJDK 1.8.0\_162
	\item [Java Virtual Machine:] OpenJDK 25.162-b12, 64-Bit, mixed mode
\end{description}
\hfill

Execution if the applications are executed through the command line command "java". Executions of benchmarking tests where no Dynamic Taint Tracker is enabled is run without a flag. Executions of tests with Dynamic Taint Trackers are called with the two flags "javaagent" and "xbootclasspath/p" where the first will point towards the Agent project jar and the second points towards the Xboot project jar.
