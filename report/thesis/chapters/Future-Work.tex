There is work needed to be done before WebTaint can take place as a solution to secure web applications. One of these is to conduct comprehensive work regarding sources, sinks, and sanitizers to ensure correct usage. It would also be of interest to implement the use of different types of sources, sinks, and sanitizers. Allowing for an advanced taint propagation where sanitizers only capable of sanitizing a specific type of data do not mark other types as safe. 

Optimizations of WebTaint is also in need since it was not prioritized during the thesis. Improvements minimizing the added overhead would make WebTaint usable in time- or memory sensitive domains. WebTaint would also benefit by enhancing the coverage of data types supporting taint propagation. The two most important data types, not supporting taint propagation in WebTaint, are char and byte arrays. 

Another possible WebTaint enhancement is implementing support of implicit taint flows. WebTaint does at the moment only support explicit flows where taint propagates if the calculated variables are directly dependent on a tainted variable. For example would $ x $ in $ x = y + 1 $ become tainted when $ y $ is tainted. The implicit flow would enable taint to propagate implicitly. A example of this is that $ x $ would be tainted in $ if (y) x = 1 $ when $ y $ is tainted.
