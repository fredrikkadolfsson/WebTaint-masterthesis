\chapter{Future Work}
\todo[inline]{Todo: Optimize code (Memory and Time), Extend data types supporting propagation, Idealy implement support for multiple list subscription (source, sink, sanitizer lists), Implement support for larger set of taintflags (sanitizers can detaint for sertain type of sinks, or all)

DDS not fully established and still under "construction". Meaning that further evaluations comparing executions of applications fully developed with the methodology DDS.
