\section{Performance Overhead}
The results from benchmarking the application on DaCapo Benchmark Suit \parencite{dacapo} is seen in Figure \ref{fig:Time} and \ref{fig:Memory}. Both graphs are constructed to show the added overhead of running the applications with Dynamic Taint Tracking activated. The graphs are conducted based on the data in Table \ref{TimeTable} and \ref{MemoryTable}.


\subsection{Time}
Figure \ref{fig:Time} displays the results of the average time overhead per application. The results show that the application with the least average time overhead was Tradesoap where 14.7\% was added. The largest application however, was Fop with an additional of 426.2\%. The average overall overhead is 142.1\%.

From the Tables \ref{TimeTable} can we as well see that the variation between the minimum and maximum time will for all applications be 437.8\%.

\subsection{Memory}
Figure \ref{fig:Memory} displays the results of the average memory overhead per application. The results show that the application with the least average memory overhead was Eclipse where 5.5\% was added. The largest application however, was Fop with an additional of 277.8\%. The average overall overhead is 127.2\%.

From the Table \ref{MemoryTable} can we as well see that the variation between the minimum and maximum memory will for all 305.3\%.

\section{Applications}
The results from running the implemented Dynamic Taint Tracker on a set of Java web applications can be seen in Tables \ref{table:MicroTable}, \ref{table:InsecureTable} and \ref{table:SnipSnapTable}. 

In Table \ref{table:MicroTable} and \ref{table:InsecureTable} where Stanford SecuriBench Micro \parencite{securiBenchMicro} respectively Insecure \parencite{insecure} have been benchmarked can we see that by using the implemented Dynamic Taint Tracker have the applications security vulnerabilities been prevented with 100\%.

The SnipSnap \parencite{snipsnap} application have seen improvements of vulnerabilities where only 10.6\% of the security vulnerabilities are left after activating the Dynamic Taint Tracker.
