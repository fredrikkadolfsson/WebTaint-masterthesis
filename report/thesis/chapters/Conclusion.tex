We can see an improvement in security when applying the dynamic taint tracker to a Java-based web application. However, there are drawbacks regarding added overhead in the form of time and memory. These are at the moment markedly noticeable but could lower through optimization. This causes the dynamic taint tracker not to be optimal if used in time- or memory sensitive domain, at least not before optimizations.
