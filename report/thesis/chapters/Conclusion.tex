\label{Conclusion}
We implemented and evaluated a dynamic taint tracker for Java-based web applications named WebTaint. The goal was that the tool would combat integrity and confidentiality vulnerabilities. The results of the conducted evaluations show improved security when using WebTaint. However, there are drawbacks regarding overhead causing WebTaint not presently being suitable for use in time- or memory sensitive domains. WebTaint could still be recommended for use in test environments where security experts utilize the taint tracker to find TaintExceptions through manual and automatic attacks.
