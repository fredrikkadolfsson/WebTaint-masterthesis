\label{Conclusion}
We implemented and evaluated a dynamic taint tracker for Java-based web applications called WebTaint. The application's goal is to combat integrity and confidentiality vulnerabilities. We can see an improvement in security when applying WebTaint to applications. However, there are drawbacks regarding added overhead in the form of time and memory. These are at the moment quite significant but could lower through optimizations. That causes webTaint not to be suitable to use in time- or memory sensitive domains.
