\label{Conclusion}
We implemented and evaluated in the thesis a dynamic taint tracker for Java-based web applications named WebTaint. The goal was that the tool could combat integrity and confidentiality vulnerabilities. The results of the conducted evaluations show improved security when using WebTaint. However, there are drawbacks regarding introduced overhead causing WebTaint not presently being suitable for use in time- or memory sensitive domains. WebTaint could be recommended for use in test environments where security experts utilize the taint tracker to find TaintExceptions through manual and automatic attacks.
