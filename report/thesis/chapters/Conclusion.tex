\label{Conclusion}
We implemented and evaluated a dynamic taint tracker for Java-based web applications called WebTaint. The goal of the tool was to combat integrity and confidentiality vulnerabilities. The results of the conducted evaluations show improved security when using WebTaint. However, there are drawbacks regarding added overhead causing WebTaint not being suitable for use in time- or memory sensitive domains. A use case for WebTaint is in test environments where security experts utilize the taint tracker to find TaintExceptions through manual or automatic attacks.
